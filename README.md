# Student Engagement Tracker

### Project Overview
The Student Engagement Tracker is designed to address the growing challenge of assessing student engagement in remote education environments. As e-learning platforms become increasingly prevalent, educators face significant hurdles in gauging students' enthusiasm and involvement effectively. Our solution aims to bridge this gap, offering real-time insights into student engagement to enhance remote teaching strategies.

### Problem Statement
- The shift to remote education, accelerated by the pandemic, has highlighted the critical need for tools that accurately measure student engagement.
- Educators struggle to assess students' levels of engagement in virtual classrooms, impacting the effectiveness of remote teaching.
- There's a pressing demand for innovative solutions that provide immediate feedback on student engagement, essential for optimizing learning outcomes.

### Approach
- **Engagement Detection System**: Implementation of a robust system utilizing OpenCV and CNN methods for real-time detection of student engagement based on eye movements and facial expressions.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Development of nuanced metrics, including screen time and facial expressions, to evaluate engagement thoroughly.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Establishment of a mechanism for categorizing students as "engaged" or "disengaged" based on their behaviors.
- **Emotional Analysis**: Integration of emotional analysis using the FER-2013 dataset to enhance the system's ability to assess cognitive and emotional engagement.

### Features
- **Emotion Detection Model**: Utilizes OpenCV for analyzing facial expressions as indicators of emotional states during academic activities.
- **Eye Gaze Detection**: Employs the dlib library for real-time eye tracking, offering insights into students' attention levels.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Provides continuous analytics, including attendance monitoring and engagement dimensions.
- **Educator's Insights Hub**: A dashboard presenting comprehensive statistics on student engagement over time.

### Demonstrations
- The project includes real-time demonstrations showcasing the system's ability to detect various engagement levels and emotional responses among students.

### Future Endeavors
- We aim to expand the model to offline classrooms, further elevating student engagement through the incorporation of feedback and insights gained from online learning environments.
